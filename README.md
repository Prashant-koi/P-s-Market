## About P's Market
P's Market is a website that will enable you to see and analyze stocks of hundreds and possibly thousands of stock markets and exchanges. You will not have to make continuous searches and look everywhere when everything is on this one website.
P's Market has a protected login feature made possible by using JWT. We are using Nodejs as the backend and MongoDB for the database server, where all your information is kept encrypted and safe.
## Description

## Challenges Faced
